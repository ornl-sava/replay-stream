# filter/emit/shift JSON objects based on their timestamp

This module will take in a [stream](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html) of JSON strings, read their specified timestamp field, and output according to the given criteria.  This can include restricting output to a certain time range, and/or outputting the items with some delay based on their timestamp.

This was created to help when replaying log events or similar recorded events, for use with the [log-tool](https://github.com/ornl-situ/log-tool) and [replay-stream](https://github.com/ornl-situ/replay-stream) projects.


## Install

npm install replay-stream


## Configuration and Usage

The following is an example of available options:

  opts = {
    "relativeTime" : false ,
    "startTime" : 0 ,
    "endTime" : moment('2013/01/01 07:07:07+0000', timeFormatter).valueOf() ,
    "timestampName" : "timestamp", 
    "timestampType" : "moment" ,
    "timestampFormat" : "YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS-Z" ,
    "stringifyOutput" : true
  }

These are defined as:
/*
 *  replayConfig.relativeTime      //if true, will output the results in 'relative time', meaning with a delay of the entry's timestamp minus the startTime argument below.
 *  replayConfig.startTime         //will ignore entries before this time.  specified in seconds, unix-style
 *  replayConfig.endTime           //will ignore entries after this time.  specified in seconds, unix-style
 *  replayConfig.timestampName     //the name of the field that contains the timestamp.  Default is "timestamp"
 *  replayConfig.timestampType     //the type of timestamp, currently only "moment" is defined.
 *  replayConfig.timestampFormat   //the format of the timesatmp, if needed.  eg. "YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS-Z"
 *  replayConfig.stringifyOutput   //will make sure that output is stringified if needed.
 */


## Development

If you are going to do development, you may want to use the [git pre-commit hook](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks), which will check the `replay-stream.js` file using [jshint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint) script (if you have it installed) and run the [mocha](visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) tests (mocha is in the git repo). If either of these fail, the commit wont work. To use the hook, from project directory, run:

    ln -s ../../scripts/pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit


## Documentation

To build the documentation and prepare the github project pages site, run:

    npm run-script docs
